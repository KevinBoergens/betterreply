By registering your app's capabilities as message actions, users can pick and choose messages to send to your app so you can do something useful with them. Store these messages in a virtual trapper keeper, feed them to your internal markov chain bot, or file away information about an important lead.

## Creating "ClipIt" app using a message action and a modal

### Developer Use-Cases

If you are developing apps like memo / note-taking app, collaborative doc app, this sample use-case would be a nice addition to your Slack app.

Also, the message action would be great for:

- Bug / issue tracking app (*e.g.* "Create a ticket from the message")
- To-Do app (*e.g.* "Create a to-do")
- Project management app (*e.g.* "Attach to task")
- Social media (*e.g.* "Post it to [my social media] App")

### User Work Flow

When a user hover a message then choose "Clip the message" from the action menu, a dialog pops open.
The message text is pre-populated into the dialog box, but the user can edit before submitting it too.
Once a user finalize the form and submit, the app DMs the user with the confirmation.
